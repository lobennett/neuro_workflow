"""FileFinder uses the BIDS-side session, not the behavioral session.

Five validation subjects (s321, s1445, s1326, s1391, s1258) have +1 offset
between behavioral and BIDS sessions. The offset is resolved at BIDS-creation
time via the reconciliation manifest's ``dest_session`` field, so by the time
lev1 runs, fmriprep paths are written under the BIDS session label and
FileFinder must respect them.

These tests build a fake fmriprep tree under the BIDS-side session for an
offset subject and confirm:
  * FileFinder discovers the run keyed by the BIDS session.
  * No data is invented for the (would-be-wrong) behavioral session.
  * If a stray behavioral-session folder exists alongside, it is reported
    independently and never substituted for the BIDS session.
